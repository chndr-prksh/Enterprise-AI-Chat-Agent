🚀 Enterprise AI Chat: The Team Knowledge Orchestrator

Enterprise AI Chat is a production-grade, multi-user Knowledge Base (KB) platform designed to turn static documents into dynamic, conversational intelligence. Unlike standard chatbots, it uses Metadata-Aware RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide highly contextualized answers based on your specific team's brand guidelines, product docs, and persona maps.

✨ Key Features

👥 Multi-User Environment: Separate private chat histories for users with a shared "Team Wisdom" layer.
🧠 Metadata-Aware RAG: Every document is tagged with its type (Brand, Persona, Product), allowing the AI to prioritize the right source for the right question.
🔄 Shared Learning Loop: Positive feedback (thumbs up) updates a global "Shared Insights" context, allowing the model to "learn" team-specific terminology and corrections over time.
📂 Intelligent Uploads: Automatic suggestions for document types (e.g., Feature Sheets, Objection Handling) help teams build robust knowledge bases from scratch.
🌐 Hybrid Intelligence: Toggle between deep document analysis and real-time Web Search using Google Search Grounding.
🎨 Premium UI/UX: A sleek, high-performance dark theme built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons.
